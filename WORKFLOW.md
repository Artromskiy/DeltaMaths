# DeltaMaths workflow

## Benchmark parameter policy

BenchmarkDotNet attributes may describe benchmark methods, categories and
lifecycle hooks, but they must not define workload or run parameters. Do not add
`[Params]`, `[ParamsSource]`, `[Arguments]`, `[ArgumentsSource]` or equivalent
parameter attributes. Parse every workload/configuration value from application
command-line arguments (or the invoking script) before BenchmarkDotNet starts,
and pass the resulting values into the benchmark runner. Keep BDN runner
switches such as `--filter` and `--job` separate from workload input. Existing
parameter attributes are migration debt: do not add new uses and replace them
when that benchmark is next modified.

The first-party benchmark runners accept workload configuration explicitly:
`--count 256`, `--count 4096`, or `--count 65536`. The version-comparison
runner also accepts `--workload <DeltaMathsWorkload>`; its default is the first
workload in each benchmark family. These options are removed before
BenchmarkDotNet discovery, so they do not become BDN parameter attributes.


## Repository layout gate

The repository must follow the shared first-party layout documented in the
Furnace project standard. Before restore/build or a structural handoff, run:

```bash
./eng/check-layout.sh
```

The gate checks the mandatory top-level directories, rejects unexpected
top-level folders, requires `src/DeltaMaths/` as the primary source project,
and requires source siblings to use the `src/DeltaMaths.<Area>/` form.
`samples/` contains runnable examples; `probes/` contains bounded
headless/compiler/contract checks. Empty mandatory domains stay tracked with
`.gitkeep`.

From the DeltaMaths repository root, regenerate first when declarations
changed. Never run an unverified stale generator binary:

```bash
dotnet build ../DeltaMathsGen/src/DeltaMathsGen/DeltaMathsGen.csproj -c Release \
  --disable-build-servers -m:1 /p:UseSharedCompilation=false
dotnet ../DeltaMathsGen/src/DeltaMathsGen/bin/Release/net8.0/DeltaMathsGen.dll src/DeltaMaths/Vectors
dotnet ../DeltaMathsGen/src/DeltaMathsGen/bin/Release/net8.0/DeltaMathsGen.dll src/DeltaMaths/Vectors
dotnet build src/DeltaMaths/DeltaMaths.csproj -c Release -f netstandard2.0 \
  --disable-build-servers -m:1 /p:UseSharedCompilation=false
dotnet build src/DeltaMaths/DeltaMaths.csproj -c Release -f netstandard2.1 \
  --disable-build-servers -m:1 /p:UseSharedCompilation=false
dotnet run --project Tests/DeltaMaths.Tests/DeltaMaths.Tests.csproj -c Release
git diff --check
```

The second generation must produce no additional diff. Inspect
`.delta-generated-files` and `src/DeltaMaths/Vectors/shader-contract.json` for ABI/layout
changes before consumer verification.

DeltaMaths owns shader-visible types and contract metadata only. It does not
publish compiled shader outputs or maintain a persistent shader catalog. When
running CPU/GPU producer checks, invoke the DeltaShader tool into a fresh
temporary directory:

```bash
out_dir="$(mktemp -d)"
trap 'rm -rf "$out_dir"' EXIT
dotnet run --project ../DeltaShader/src/DeltaShader.Tool/DeltaShader.Tool.csproj \
  -c Release -- maths-conformance "$PWD" \
  --profile vulkan1.2 --spirv 1.5 --glsl 460 \
  --optimize performance --out "$out_dir"
```

Do not create a Maths-local compiled-shader directory or mix lock files into
the temporary output.

Do not run version benchmarks during ordinary review. Use the manual workflow
only when the user asks for a version comparison.

## Managed math spelling

Consumer projects should use the canonical managed facade with an explicit
namespace import:

```csharp
using Delta;

var length = Maths.Sqrt(value);
```

The lowercase `maths.*` facade and `using static Delta.maths` are reserved
for shader-authoring code. The provider intentionally keeps the case-only
`Maths`/`maths` pair; this is the scoped reason for its CA1708/CA1724
suppression. `DeltaMaths` is the provider's established
implementation name and a forwarding target for compatibility; new consumer
code must not call it directly. The provider itself may use `System.Math` and
`System.MathF` inside `Maths.cs`, `Maths.half.cs` and `MathCompat.cs` to
implement the portable scalar primitives. This is the only provider exception;
do not replace these calls with ad-hoc numerical approximations.

## Contract versioning

Any change to the public API or the cross-project shader/runtime contract
requires a new release version by default. Before merging such a change,
increment the package version in `src/DeltaMaths/DeltaMaths.csproj` and create
an annotated Git tag with the same numeric version using the `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
form. Read the current value from the project file or the latest tag; do not
copy a package version into this document.
The tag and package version may differ only when the user explicitly requests
an exception. Documentation-only, test-only and internal implementation
changes do not require a version increment unless they alter the shipped
package or contract metadata.

## Code metrics

Run the shared Furnace wrappers from this repository before every commit; see
the [common workflow](../REVIEW_PLAYBOOK.md#shared-local-formatter-and-metrics-wrappers):

```bash
../eng/format.sh "$PWD"
FORMAT_CHECK=1 ../eng/format.sh "$PWD"
../eng/code-metrics.sh "$PWD" -v:q
```

Set `CODE_METRICS_ERROR_LOG` when a different SARIF destination is needed:

```bash
CODE_METRICS_ERROR_LOG=/tmp/deltamaths-metrics.sarif \
  ../eng/code-metrics.sh "$PWD" -v:q
```

Inspect the SARIF and summary artifacts from the manual workflow. The rules
CA1501/CA1502/CA1505/CA1506 are report-only signals; do not refactor a method
for one isolated warning. Refactor when several metrics remain over their
limits, the issue persists across runs, or profiling identifies a hot path.


## NuGet

NuGet has only the workspace `dev` and `release` modes. Run them from the
Furnace root as documented in
[`docs/NUGET_WORKFLOW.md`](../docs/NUGET_WORKFLOW.md). `DeltaMathsGen` is an
internal generator executable and is not a publishable package.

`DeltaMathsGen` is intentionally not a publishable NuGet package. It is a
`net8.0` executable used to regenerate DeltaMaths sources and the shader
contract from its sibling checkout. Build and invoke it using the generation
commands above; do not pack or publish a `DeltaMathsGen` package.
